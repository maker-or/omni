/**
 * Git-state tone tokens.
 *
 * The workspace surfaces (the control panel header, its action buttons, and
 * the sidebar's active workspace card) all derive their colour from one tone
 * vocabulary, so the same git state reads the same colour everywhere. This
 * module is the single source for that mapping; components import from here
 * rather than re-declaring colours.
 *
 * Header tone is git truth:
 * - neutral: no PR yet (fresh worktree or work in progress)
 * - action:  PR open but something blocks merging (dirty tree, draft,
 *            checks running or failing)
 * - ready:   PR open, tree clean, checks green — merge is the next step
 * - merged:  the branch's PR landed — delete the workspace or continue on
 *            a fresh branch
 * - stale:   no PR and nothing of the user's own to save or share, but the
 *            base branch has moved on — catching up is the next step
